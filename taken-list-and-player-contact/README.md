# Taken List and Player Contact Automation

This script was coded for easing up the procedure of entering and removing new data from a list of predetermined signups. Initially, an HTML template for each player/character entry had to be copied, with each new detail manually inputted. With this script, all the user has to do is to input data in a spreadsheet, and the script converts the data into its HTML/displayable equivalent.

A live preview/copyable implementation of the spreadsheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cdgOA4xHuRRbQAvPhOh99tmjXiihMmYaCVe-8JHb_Xs/edit?usp=sharing).
